A variety of devices are available for use at SSRL-DeNovX.  Currently only 
High Throughput (HiTp) diffraction is supported, but more functionality will
be added in the future.  

While most PV's are accessible from the ipython session, it's generally 
advised to use the GUI elements to adjust parameters like exposure time or 
frame rates.
